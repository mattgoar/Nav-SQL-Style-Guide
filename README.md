# Navigant SQL Best Practices Guide

As SQL is a primarly language within our Analytics team, best practices are required in order to maintain reproducibility and transparency across teams and projects. Additionally, adhering to our best practices will improve our ability to share, maintain, and extend our research when working with SQL.

This document is written as a manual for anyone working on the Analytics team, but also as a guide for anyone at the company who would like to write clean and clear code that is meant to be shared.
 
If you have questions or suggestions for modifications and improvements, please reach out to Matt Goar.
