# Table Naming Guidelines

## General Guidelines
* Naming Conventions
    * Ensure the name is unique and does not exist as a reserved keyword.
    * Names must begin with a letter and may not end with an underscore.
    * Only use letters, numbers and underscores in names.
    * Avoid the use of multiple consecutive underscoresâ€”these can be hard to read.
    * Use underscores where you would naturally include a space in the name (first name becomes first_name).
    * Avoid abbreviations and if you have to use them make sure they are commonly understood.
